/**
 * @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
 *
 * @Configuration tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
 *
 * @EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
 *
 * Normally you would add @EnableWebMvc for a Spring MVC app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. This flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
 *
 * @ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the hello package, allowing it to find the controllers.

/**
 * The @EnableAsync annotation switches on Springâ€™s ability to run @Async methods in a background thread pool. This class also customizes the used Executor. In our case, we want to limit the number of concurrent threads to 2 and limit the size of the queue to 500. There are many more things you can tune. By default, a SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor is used.
